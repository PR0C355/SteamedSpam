# SteamedSpam

## Setup Notes

by Alanna

1. Clone this repository into VSCode (https://github.com/PR0C355/SteamedSpam.git) and open the project.
2. (I am not sure if this step is necessary, but I needed to do this.) Create a virtual environment to run the Jupyter Notebook and install all necessary packages.
   - If you have Anaconda, this can be done with the line: `conda create -c conda-forge -n sk-jupyter python="3.11.6" pandas scikit-learn`. This creates a conda virtual environment named "sk-jupyter" with python v3.11.6, pandas, and scikit-learn packages installed.
   - Alternatively, you can create a Python virtual environment and install packages with pip instead

#### Other notes:

- In order to install other packages in a conda environment, follow the command format:  
  `conda install \<package-name\>` (e.g. conda install scikit-learn)
- Tumi and Alanna are using Python v3.11.6

#### Packages used:

- scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
- pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html
